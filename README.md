# Weekend Challenge: jQuery Salary Calculator
Create an application that records employee salaries and adds salaries up to report monthly costs. 

## Description
_Duration: 2-Day weekend sprint_

Need to calculate the monthly salary cost of all of your employees? Maybe it is review season and you need to stay under budget when considering raises? Look no further!

Here you can input your employee information and get a total monthly salary cost at the end. Want to change employee information you already input? Use the delete button to remove the employee from your list and calculation. Want to change your monthly budget? A field is provided to update that information.
